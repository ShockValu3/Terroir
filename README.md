# Terroir Modules

Welcome to **Terroir**, a growing collection of focused, thoughtfully-designed Eurorack modules for [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/).

### ðŸªµ Design Philosophy

Terroir modules are made with a "do one thing well" approach â€” minimal, clean interfaces that encourage exploration. Every parameter is musical, meaningful, and designed with an eye toward possible future hardware implementation. Inspired by the ethos of modular synthesis itself: composability, personality, and intentional limits.

Each module is:
- Easy to patch without a manual
- Built for creative modulation
- Biased toward organic control over randomness

The aesthetic is Dieter Rams meets modern DSP: simple, sturdy, and expressive.

## ðŸ§­ Current Module(s)

### **Lure**
> *A bias-centered, force-field-driven Brownian walk.*

**Lure** generates smooth, drifting voltages within a user-defined range. Its output is shaped by:
- **Min / Max**: Define output bounds
- **Bias**: Sets the center point the voltage is attracted to
- **Pull**: Controls gravitational strength toward the bias
- **Speed**: Adjusts how quickly the output drifts

All parameters can be CV-modulated, including through attenuverters.

Use Lure for:
- Random modulation with character
- Slowly evolving control signals
- Quantized melody walks
- Generative systems with direction
